          <p>Tomb for Two is a local 2-player dungeon crawler where Anubis and Bastet have been trapped in a pyramid. Set in a far-off futuristic world, the two players must escape the pyramid by defeating enemies and solving puzzles together! Tomb for Two was my second project with Spartasoft Studio. I worked as a programmer for the project working on the room randomization. I also added quality of life features such as the line to help aim as Bastet. </p>

          <p> Nighttail Chronicles is a horror-fantasy free-roam and simple puzzle game. The player, as a security guard, works during the daytime at a zoo. An animal escape occurred, and to survive the night at this mansion full of fantasy creatures the player must navigate through different buildings. I worked as a programmer and designer for Night Chronicles. I did the art and design implementation of the game. This was also the first project I worked on where I had to work with Manager scripts. </p>

          <p> Labyrinth was a project I made alone. It was a maze, extraction game. The key features of it were its procedurally generated mazes, and the unique hidden doors. </p>

          <p>Knight by Night is a 2D Visual Novel / Adventure game where you play as Ashling, an aspiring knight with the ability to traverse the other's dreams. Ashling finds themselves in the small town of Albtraum, where its townsfolk are riddled with problems. Help the citizens of Albtraum by getting to know their personalities during the day, then entering their dreams to fight their fears... literally! This was my first project with Spartasoft Studio. I worked as one of its Design Director helping my team by giving them tasks to finish along with designing the maps on one of the levels. </p>

          <p>This was a game I made, inspired by Pico Park. It was my one of my first projects. I felt had unique twist on it taking a multiplayer game and turning it into a singer player game.</p>
